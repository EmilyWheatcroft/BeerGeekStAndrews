<center><h2> To get the lowdown on beer in this town, we've sat down with three people in a prime position to influence craft beer culture in St A:
  <p>President of the University's Craft Beer Society, Andrew Wilson, Manager of Luvians Bottleshop, Archie McDiarmid, and Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company, Libby Dougall. </p>
We ask them the important questions - how can we continue St Andrews' great craft beer scene, what makes a great beer and, eh, should Tennents be returned to The Union...

<h3> First up, it's Andrew: </h3>

<p><h29> What's the best beer you've made? </h29>
<h4>  Probably my "imperial" stout, even if it didnt work properly and was only about 6 %. A good stout should be rich and decadent and a few of us in the society contributed a bit of our own money so we could get stuff like vanilla pods and cacao nibs to achieve that. Next version needs more coffee though. </h4></p>

<p><h30> What're you making next? </h30>
<h5> We've just bottled out vermont IPA so i think i'd really like to have a go at making some sours next, partly for the challenge/ learning experience but mainly because sours are great. </h5> </p>

<p><h31> Why should we be brewing our own beer? </h31></p>
<p><h6> Because its easy. The hard part comes with designing the recipes but once you get a good bit of knowledge in that regard you gain a whole new respect for beers you drink. That said, that has also made me hugely critical of any beers where i can tell the brewers have been lazy or cheap so maybe my point is that brewing makes you a more discerning drinker. </h6></p>

<p><h32> Favourite locally produced beer? </h32> </p>
<p><h7> Simon from StABCo did a barrel aged, bretted berlinner wiesse a while back which was great. They've got some great brewers over there but i wish they were given more chance to prove it. I feel like there's a lot of wasted potential in that company. </h7></p>

<p>
<h34> Favourite beer ever? </h34> </p>
<p><h9> Almanac - Farm to Barrel. Its crazy sour and each sip changes in your mouth over time, lasting about 20 seconds. It was a religious experience. </h9> </p>

<p>
<h33> Favourite bar in town? </h33> </p>
<p><h8> Back when it started and it was good, StABCo. Now i'd probably have to say Aikmans for their great belgian beer selection which Malcolm clearly really cares about. </h8> </p>

<p>
<h35> Favourite bar ever? </h35> </p>
<p><h10> CASC in Aberdeen. </h10> </p>

<p>
<h36> Should we bring Tennents back to The Union? </36> </P>
<p><h11> Yes. It may not be good but its better than Carling by a long way. Back when the union was getting tennents the supplier was better on the whole too.</h11> </p>

<p>
<h37> Why should we all be joining Craft Beer Society? </h37> </P>
<p><h12> Because we have beer. </h12> </p>

<p>
<p><h13> Next, we chatted to Archie McDiarmid of Luvians Bottleshop. When not managing the shop, Archie also contributes to craft beer magazine, Ferment, with a regular column on all things boozy. </h13> </p> </p>

<h38> How has beer changed since you were at uni here? </h38>
<h39> Bad beer hasn't changed much. Other than the scandalous move away from Tennant's in the Union,
the same big beer brands are still available in the same places. Tax has made them more expensive (no more pound a pint happy hours,
in fact thanks to legislation, no more happy hours, just 72 hour promotions). </h39>

<h40> And how has it changed from a retail point of view, since you first became manager around five years ago? </h40>

<h42> In terms of craft beer, we've now got beer kitchen, brewco, the rule,
brewdog over in Dundee - are we gonna see over saturation or is this still great for such a small town? </h42>


<h44> What's your favourite locally produced beer? </h44>

<h46> Favourite pub in town? </h46>

<h48> Favourite bar ever? </h48>

<h50> Favourite beer ever? </50>

<h52> How can St Andrews stay relevant in craft beer? </h52>

<h54> Is craft beer expansion going to continue or are we going to see a bubble burst, like some are expecting with gin ‘craft’ craze ? </h54>

<h56> Should Tennents be returned to the union? </h56>

<h58> Lastly, Why should we all be shopping at Luvians? </h58>z

<h14> Finally, we spoke to Libby Dougall, Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company </h14>

<p> <h22> <i> How do you think St Andrews Brewing Company has changed beer in St Andrews? </i> </h22> </p>
<h15> I think Stabco has really helped with piquing interest in craft beer in St Andrews. Obviously places like Luvians are fantastic and offer a great selection, but a bar setting is the perfect medium for introducing people to new styles of beer and helping them find new beers that match their tastes. It also allows us to educate people about small independent breweries. </h15>

<p> <h25> <i> What's your favourite locally produced beer? </i> </h25> </p>
<h16> Chai Porter is my absolute favourite of our beers. We've finally brewed a new batch after bloody ages, so really excited for that! </h16>

<p> <h24> <i> What's your favourite place for a drink in town? </i> </h24> </p>
<h17> Stabco Duh </h17>

<p> <h26> <i> What's your favourite beer ever? </i> </h26></p>
<p><h18> Omg that's like asking me to pick my favourite child. I'm all about my Sours and Imperial Stouts. Anything by Cantillion is banging or Omnipollo and omg I love Pompelmocello. I could keep going. </h18> </p>


<p> <h27> <i> Should we be bringing back Tennents to The Union? </i> </h27>
<h20> I mean I hate lager, but as crappy lagers go Tennents is fine. If people want to drink it in the Union then sure. </h20> </p>

<h28> <i> Finally, why should we all be drinking at StabCo? </i> </h28>
<h21> Because it's the best bar in town. Duh.</h21> </section> </div> </center>
