<center><h2> To get the lowdown on beer in this town, we've sat down with three people in a prime position to influence craft beer culture in St A:
  <p>President of the University's Craft Beer Society, Andrew Wilson, Manager of Luvians Bottleshop, Archie McDiarmid, and Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company, Libby Dougall. </p>
We ask them the important questions - how can we continue St Andrews' great craft beer scene, what makes a great beer and, eh, should Tennents be returned to The Union...

<h3> First up, it's Andrew: </h3>

<i><p><h29> What's the best beer you've made? </h29></i>
<h4>  Probably my "imperial" stout, even if it didnt work properly and was only about 6 %. A good stout should be rich and decadent and a few of us in the society contributed a bit of our own money so we could get stuff like vanilla pods and cacao nibs to achieve that. Next version needs more coffee though. </h4></p>

<i><p><h30> What're you making next? </h30></i>
<h5> We've just bottled out vermont IPA so i think i'd really like to have a go at making some sours next, partly for the challenge/ learning experience but mainly because sours are great. </h5> </p>

<i><p><h31> Why should we be brewing our own beer? </h31></p></i>
<p><h6> Because its easy. The hard part comes with designing the recipes but once you get a good bit of knowledge in that regard you gain a whole new respect for beers you drink. That said, that has also made me hugely critical of any beers where i can tell the brewers have been lazy or cheap so maybe my point is that brewing makes you a more discerning drinker. </h6></p>

<i><p><h32> Favourite locally produced beer? </h32> </p></i>
<p><h7> Simon from StABCo did a barrel aged, bretted berlinner wiesse a while back which was great. They've got some great brewers over there but i wish they were given more chance to prove it. I feel like there's a lot of wasted potential in that company. </h7></p>

<p>
<i><h34> Favourite beer ever? </h34> </p></i>
<p><h9> Almanac - Farm to Barrel. Its crazy sour and each sip changes in your mouth over time, lasting about 20 seconds. It was a religious experience. </h9> </p>

<p>
<i><h33> Favourite bar in town? </h33> </p></i>
<p><h8> Back when it started and it was good, StABCo. Now i'd probably have to say Aikmans for their great belgian beer selection which Malcolm clearly really cares about. </h8> </p>

<p>
<i><h35> Favourite bar ever? </h35> </p></i>
<p><h10> CASC in Aberdeen. </h10> </p>

<p>
<i><h36> Should we bring Tennents back to The Union? </36> </P></i>
<p><h11> Yes. It may not be good but its better than Carling by a long way. Back when the union was getting tennents the supplier was better on the whole too.</h11> </p>

<p>
<i><h37> Why should we all be joining Craft Beer Society? </h37> </P></i>
<p><h12> Because we have beer. </h12> </p>

<p><h13> Next, we chatted to Archie McDiarmid of Luvians Bottleshop. When not managing the shop, Archie also contributes to craft beer magazine, Ferment, with a regular column on all things boozy. </h13> </p> </p>

<p><h38> How has beer changed since you were at uni here? </h38></p>

<p><h39> Bad beer hasn't changed much. Other than the scandalous move away from Tennant's in the Union,
the same big beer brands are still available in the same places. Tax has made them more expensive (no more pound a pint happy hours,
in fact thanks to legislation, no more happy hours, just 72 hour promotions).
The number of bars hasn't changed, but they are more specialised (Adamson, Brewpub etc) and the arrival of two super
 local breweries and a much stronger brewing scene in Scotland generally has seen a move away from the continental
 domination of the 'good beer' market. People don't think 'I want a good beer' and automatically go for a Belgian triple
 or German lager at Aikmans for example.
The massive sea change has been at the quality end of the market. Cask beer is now less prominent, and for me,
   less well looked after. The CAMRA crowd is now less influential, both for good and bad.
</h39></p>

<p><h40> And how has it changed from a retail point of view, since you first became manager around five years ago? </h40></p>
<h60>The last 5 years has seen a massive jump in exploration over brand loyalty. There are so many constantly emerging new beers
that people now actively seek out new beers over ones they have tried before (even if they enjoyed them) As a result there
is a need for constant turnover of lines (Luvians sold over 2000 unique beers lines last year) </h60>




<p><h42> In terms of craft beer, we've now got Beer Kitchen, BrewCo, The Rule,
Brewdog over in Dundee - are we gonna see over saturation or is this still great for such a small town? </h42></p>
<p><h61> The range of choice in terms of bars is a great sign for such a small town. They all specialise to a greater
  or lesser extent so you now have a variety of drinking experiences o chose from as a consumer. The competition also
  forces everyone to raise there standards which can only be a good thing.
By encouraging a diverse eco-system of bars. It worries me that G1 now owns 4 restaurants and 2 bars in town. We also
need to keep comparing ourselves to the best places outside St Andrews. It is very easy to sit back and make money in
St Andrews by being 'good enough', but to really excite people we need to be exceptional for anywhere, not just 'quite good'
for a small town in Scotland. It can be done look at our chip shops, Cromars & Tailend didn't exist 10 years ago, now they
rank among the best in the U.K.
</p></h61>


<p><h44> What's your favourite locally produced beer? </h44></p>
<p><h62>Favourite local beer - as a retailer that is a dangerously political
question, so I'll go from one from each local brewery StABCo Chai Porter & Eden Paritch Broo </p></h62>

<p><h46> Favourite pub in town? </h46></p>
<p><h63> For beer (or wine randomly) StABCo, for whisky The Keys, for cocktails Adamson
For nostalgia & darts The Whey Pat!</p></h63>

<p><h48> Favourite bar ever? </h48></p>
<p><h64>In St Andrews, because it was my first experience working in bars and when it was buzzing
it was phenomenal the old Ogstons (now the Rule). Worldwide Bramble in Edinburgh & Anna's in
St Helena. Wildly different, but both share the same passion for crafting a great customer experience.<p></h64>


<p><h50> Favourite beer ever? </50></p>
<p><h52> All time Mikkeller Black Hole, regular drinking Tempest Brave New World. </p></h52>


<p><h54> Is craft beer expansion going to continue or are we going to see a bubble burst, like some are expecting with gin ‘craft’ craze ? </h54></p>

<p><h65> Craft beer is becoming a more mature market, so the rate of openings will slow down and the model is changing. Because the barriers to entry are so
low you will always get new players coming on the the market, but breaking out of you local market is now much harder because there are so many other
options out there. It will become more common to see one man band breweries earn their stripes, then pack up as the founder goes to work for a bigger,
better funded operations. From a consumer point of view overall consumption hasn't really changed, we've just changed what we're drinking. The rate of
growth of craft vs macro will slow down, but still has plenty of room to grow as new generations of drinkers enter the newly diverse marketplace. <p></h65>


<p><h56> Should Tennents be returned to the union? </h56></p>
<p><h66>Yes - it might be terrible, fizzy, flavourless slop, but it is OUR terrible, fizzy,
  flavourless slop. If you are Scottish & you're going to drink terrible lager, it should be Vitamin T!</p></h66>

<p><h58> Lastly, Why should we all be shopping at Luvians? </h58></p>
<p><h67>Because we have one of the best selections of wine, beer & spirits in the U.K.
  let alone Scotland and they have all been chosen by people who love drinks and want
  to share that passion with our customers. Besides most people come to St Andrews to
  learn or to enjoy the best that Scotland has to offer and Luvians let's you do both
  all while you have a drink on your hand.</p></h67>

<h14> Finally, we spoke to Libby Dougall, Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company </h14>

<p>
<p> <h22> <i> How do you think St Andrews Brewing Company has changed beer in St Andrews? </i> </h22> </p>
<p><h15> I think Stabco has really helped with piquing interest in craft beer in St Andrews.
Obviously places like Luvians are fantastic and offer a great selection,
but a bar setting is the perfect medium for introducing people to new styles of beer and helping them find new beers that match their tastes.
It also allows us to educate people about small independent breweries. </h15></p>

<p>
<p> <h25> <i> What's your favourite locally produced beer? </i> </h25></p>
<p><h16> Chai Porter is my absolute favourite of our beers. We've finally brewed a new batch after bloody ages, so really excited for that! </h16></p>

<p>
<p> <h24> <i> What's your favourite place for a drink in town? </i> </h24></p>
<p><h17> Stabco, duh </h17></p>

<p>
<p> <h26> <i> What's your favourite beer ever? </i> </h26></p>
<p><h18> Omg that's like asking me to pick my favourite child. I'm all about my Sours and Imperial Stouts.
Anything by Cantillion is banging or Omnipollo and omg I love Pompelmocello. I could keep going. </h18> </p>

<p>
<p> <h27> <i> Should we be bringing back Tennents to The Union? </i> </h27></p>
<p><h20> I mean I hate lager, but as crappy lagers go Tennents is fine. If people want to drink it in the Union then sure. </h20> </p>

<p>
<p><h28> <i> Finally, why should we all be drinking at StabCo? </i> </h28></p>
<p><h21> Because it's the best bar in town. Duh.</h21> </section> </div> </center></p>
