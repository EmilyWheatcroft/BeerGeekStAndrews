<center><h2> To get the lowdown on beer in this town, we've sat down with three people in a prime position to influence craft beer culture in St A:
  <p>President of the University's Craft Beer Society, Andrew Wilson, Manager of Luvians Bottleshop, Archie McDiarmid, and Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company, Libby Dougall. </p>
We ask them the important questions - how can we continue St Andrews' great craft beer scene, what makes a great beer and, eh, should Tennents be returned to The Union...

<h3> First up, it's Andrew: </h3>

<i><p><h29> What's the best beer you've made? </h29></i>
<h4>  <p>Probably my "imperial" stout, even if it didnt work properly and was only about 6 %.</p>
<p> A good stout should be rich and decadent and a few of us in the society contributed a bit of our </p> 
<p>own money so we could get stuff like vanilla pods and cacao nibs to achieve that. Next version needs more coffee though. </h4></p>

<i><p><h29> What're you making next? </h29></i></p>
<h4><p> We've just bottled out vermont IPA so i think i'd really like to have a go at making some sours next,</p>
<p> partly for the challenge/ learning experience but mainly because sours are great. </h4> </p>

<i><p><h29> Why should we be brewing our own beer? </h29></p></i>
<p><h4> Because its easy. The hard part comes with designing the recipes but once you get a good bit of knowledge</p>
<p>in that regard you gain a whole new respect for beers you drink. That said, that has also made me hugely critical of </p>
<p> any beers where i can tell the brewers have been lazy or cheap so maybe my point is that brewing makes you a more discerning drinker. </h4></p>

<i><p><h29> Favourite locally produced beer? </h29> </p></i>
<p><h4> Simon from StABCo did a barrel aged, bretted berlinner wiesse a while back which was great. They've got some great <p>
</p> brewers over there but I wish they were given more chance to prove it. I feel like there's a lot of wasted potential in that company. </h4></p>

<p>
<i><h29> Favourite beer ever? </h29> </p></i>
<p><h4> Almanac - Farm to Barrel. Its crazy sour and each sip changes in your mouth over time, lasting about 20 seconds. </p>
<p> It was a religious experience. </h4> </p>

<p>
<i><h29> Favourite bar in town? </h29> </p></i>
<p><h4> Back when it started and it was good, StABCo. Now i'd probably have to say Aikmans for their great belgian beer </p>
<p>selection which Malcolm clearly really cares about. </h4> </p>

<p>
<i><h29> Favourite bar ever? </h29> </p></i>
<p><h4> CASC in Aberdeen. </h4> </p>

<p>
<i><h29> Should we bring Tennents back to The Union? </29> </p></i>
<p><h4> Yes. It may not be good but its better than Carling by a long way. Back when the union was getting tennents </p>
<p> the supplier was better on the whole too.</h4> </p>

<p>
<i><h29> Why should we all be joining Craft Beer Society? </h29> </p></i>
<p><h4> Because we have beer. </h4> </p>

<p><h2> Next, we chatted to Archie McDiarmid of Luvians Bottleshop. When not managing the shop, </p>
<p> Archie also contributes to craft beer magazine, Ferment, with a regular column on all things boozy. </h13> </p> </p>

<p><h29> How has beer changed since you were at uni here? </h29></p>

<p><h4> Bad beer hasn't changed much. Other than the scandalous move away from Tennant's in the Union, </p>
<p>the same big beer brands are still available in the same places. Tax has made them more expensive (no more pound a pint happy hours,</p>
<p>in fact thanks to legislation, no more happy hours, just 72 hour promotions). </p>
<p>The number of bars hasn't changed, but they are more specialised (Adamson, Brewpub etc) and the arrival of two super </p>
<p> local breweries and a much stronger brewing scene in Scotland generally has seen a move away from the continental </p>
<p> domination of the 'good beer' market. People don't think 'I want a good beer' and automatically go for a Belgian triple </p>
<p> or German lager at Aikmans for example. </p>
<p>The massive sea change has been at the quality end of the market. Cask beer is now less prominent, and for me, </p>
<p>   less well looked after. The CAMRA crowd is now less influential, both for good and bad. </p>
</h4></p>

<p><h29> And how has it changed from a retail point of view, since you first became manager around five years ago? </h40></p>
<h4><p>The last 5 years has seen a massive jump in exploration over brand loyalty. There are so many constantly emerging new beers </p>
<p>that people now actively seek out new beers over ones they have tried before (even if they enjoyed them) As a result there </p>
<p>is a need for constant turnover of lines (Luvians sold over 2000 unique beers lines last year) </h4></p>




<p><h29> In terms of craft beer, we've now got Beer Kitchen, BrewCo, The Rule,</p>
<p>Brewdog over in Dundee - are we gonna see over saturation or is this still great for such a small town? </h29></p>
<p><h4> The range of choice in terms of bars is a great sign for such a small town. They all specialise to a greater</p>
 <p>or lesser extent so you now have a variety of drinking experiences o chose from as a consumer. The competition also</p>
 <p>forces everyone to raise there standards which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>By encouraging a diverse eco-system of bars. It worries me that G1 now owns 4 restaurants and 2 bars in town. We also</p>
<p>need to keep comparing ourselves to the best places outside St Andrews. It is very easy to sit back and make money in</p>
<p>St Andrews by being 'good enough', but to really excite people we need to be exceptional for anywhere, not just 'quite good'</p>
<p>for a small town in Scotland. It can be done look at our chip shops, Cromars & Tailend didn't exist 10 years ago, now they</p>
<p>rank among the best in the U.K.
</p></h4>


<p><h29> What's your favourite locally produced beer? </h29></p>
<p><h4>Favourite local beer - as a retailer that is a dangerously political </p>
<p>question, so I'll go from one from each local brewery StABCo Chai Porter & Eden Paritch Broo </p></h4>

<p><h29> Favourite pub in town? </h29></p>
<p><h4> For beer (or wine randomly) StABCo, for whisky The Keys, for cocktails Adamson </p>
<p>For nostalgia & darts The Whey Pat!</p></h4>

<p><h29> Favourite bar ever? </h29></p>
<p><h4>In St Andrews, because it was my first experience working in bars and when it was buzzing</p>
<p>it was phenomenal the old Ogstons (now the Rule). Worldwide Bramble in Edinburgh & Anna's in</p>
<p>St Helena. Wildly different, but both share the same passion for crafting a great customer experience.<p></h4>


<p><h29> Favourite beer ever? </29></p>
<p><h4> All time Mikkeller Black Hole, regular drinking Tempest Brave New World. </p></h4>


<p><h29> Is craft beer expansion going to continue or are we going to see a bubble burst, like some are expecting with gin ‘craft’ craze ? </h29></p>

<p><h4> Craft beer is becoming a more mature market, so the rate of openings will slow down and the model is changing. Because the barriers</p><p> to entry are so
low you will always get new players coming on the the market, but breaking out of you local </p><p> market is now much harder because there are so many other
options out there. It will become more common to see one man band breweries</p><p> earn their stripes, then pack up as the founder goes to work for a bigger,
better funded operations. From a consumer point of view overall</p><p> consumption hasn't really changed, we've just changed what we're drinking. The rate of
growth of craft vs macro will slow down,</p><p> but still has plenty of room to grow as new generations of drinkers enter the newly diverse marketplace. </p></h4>


<p><h29> Should Tennents be returned to the union? </h29></p>
<p><h4>Yes - it might be terrible, fizzy, flavourless slop, but it is OUR terrible, fizzy,</p>
<p>flavourless slop. If you are Scottish & you're going to drink terrible lager, it should be Vitamin T!</p></h4>

<p><h29> Lastly, Why should we all be shopping at Luvians? </h29></p>
<p><h4>Because we have one of the best selections of wine, beer & spirits in the U.K.</p>
<p>  let alone Scotland and they have all been chosen by people who love drinks and want</p>
<p>  to share that passion with our customers. Besides most people come to St Andrews to</p>
<p>  learn or to enjoy the best that Scotland has to offer and Luvians let's you do both</p>
<p>  all while you have a drink on your hand.</p></h4>

<h14> Finally, we spoke to Libby Dougall, Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company </h14>

<center><img src="libby.jpg" width=400, height=400, align-content-center>

<p>
<p> <h29> <i> How do you think St Andrews Brewing Company has changed beer in St Andrews? </i> </h29> </p>
<p><h4> I think Stabco has really helped with piquing interest in craft beer in St Andrews.</p>
<p>Obviously places like Luvians are fantastic and offer a great selection,</p>
<p>but a bar setting is the perfect medium for introducing people to new styles of beer and helping them find new beers that match</p><p> their tastes.
It also allows us to educate people about small independent breweries. </h4></p>

<p>
<p> <h29> <i> What's your favourite locally produced beer? </i> </h29></p>
<p><h4> Chai Porter is my absolute favourite of our beers. We've finally brewed a new batch after bloody ages,</p><p> so really excited for that! </h4></p>

<p>
<p> <h29> <i> What's your favourite place for a drink in town? </i> </h29></p>
<p><h4> Stabco, duh </h4></p>

<p>
<p> <h29> <i> What's your favourite beer ever? </i> </h29></p>
<p><h4> Omg that's like asking me to pick my favourite child. I'm all about my Sours and Imperial Stouts.
Anything by Cantillion is banging or Omnipollo and omg I love Pompelmocello. I could keep going. </h4> </p>

<p>
<p> <h29> <i> Should we be bringing back Tennents to The Union? </i> </h29></p>
<p><h4> I mean I hate lager, but as crappy lagers go Tennents is fine. If people want to drink it in the Union then sure. </h4> </p>

<p>
<p><h29> <i> Finally, why should we all be drinking at StabCo? </i> </h29></p>
<p><h24> Because it's the best bar in town. Duh.</h4> </section> </div> </center></p>
