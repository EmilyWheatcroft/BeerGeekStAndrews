<h2> To get the lowdown on beer in this town, we've sat down with three people in a prime position to influence craft beer culture in St A:
  Preisdent of the University's Craft Beer Society, Andrew Wilson, Manager of Luvians Bottleshop, Archie McDiarmid, and Assistant Manager of St Andrews Brewing Company, Libby Dougall.

<h3> First up, it's Andrew: </h3>

<h4>  1. probably my "imperial" stout, even if it didnt work properly and was only about 6 %. A good stout  should be rich and decadent and a few of us in the society contributed a bit of our own money so we could get stuff like vanilla pods and cacao nibs to achieve that. Next version needs more coffee though. </h4>

<h5> 2. We've just bottled out vermont IPA so i think i'd really like to have a go at making some sours next, partly for the challenge/ learning experience but mainly because sours are great. </h5>

<h6> 3.  Because its easy. The hard part comes with designing the recipes but once you get a good bit of knowledge in that regard you gain a whole new respect for beers you drink. That said, that has also made me hugely critical of any beers where i can tell the brewers have been lazy or cheap so maybe my point is that brewing makes you a more discerning drinker. </h6>

<h7> 4. Simon from StABCo did a barrel aged, bretted berlinner wiesse a while back which was great. They've got some great brewers over there but i wish they were given more chance to prove it. I feel like there's a lot of wasted potential in that company. </h7>

<h8> 5. Back when it started and it was good, StABCo. Now i'd probably have to say Aikmans for their great belgian beer selection which Malcolm clearly really cares about. </h8>

<h9> 6. Almanac - Farm to Barrel. Its crazy sour and each sip changes in your mouth over time, lasting about 20 seconds. It was a religious experience. </h9>

<h10> 7. CASC in Aberdeen. </h10>

<h11> 8. Yes. It may not be good but its better than carling by a long way. Back when the union was getting tennents the supplier was better on the whole too.</h11>

<h12> 9. Because we have beer. </h12>

<h13> Next, we chatted to Archie McDiarmid of Luvians Bottleshop. When not managing the shop, Archie also contributes to craft beer magazine, Ferment, with a regular column on all things boozy. </h13>
